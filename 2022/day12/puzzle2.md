## --- Part Two ---

As you walk up the hill, you suspect that the Elves will want to turn this into a hiking trail. The beginning isn't very scenic, though; perhaps you can find a better starting point.

To maximize exercise while hiking, the trail should start as low as possible: elevation `a`. The goal is still the square marked `E`. However, the trail should still be direct, taking the fewest steps to reach its goal. So, you'll need to find the shortest path from **any square at elevation `a`** to the square marked `E`.

Again consider the example from above:

```
Sabqponm
abcryxxl
accszExk
acctuvwj
abdefghi
```

Now, there are six choices for starting position (five marked `a`, plus the square marked `S` that counts as being at elevation `a`). If you start at the bottom-left square, you can reach the goal most quickly:

```
...v<<<<
...vv<<^
...v>E^^
.>v>>>^^
>^>>>>>^
```

This path reaches the goal in only **`29`** steps, the fewest possible.

**What is the fewest steps required to move starting from any square with elevation `a` to the location that should get the best signal?**

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](input.txt).
