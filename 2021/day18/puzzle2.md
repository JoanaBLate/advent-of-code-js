## --- Part Two ---

You notice a second question on the back of the homework assignment:

What is the largest magnitude you can get from adding only two of the snailfish numbers?

Note that snailfish addition is not [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative**property) - that is, `x + y` and `y + x` can produce different results.

Again considering the last example homework assignment above:

```
[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]
[[[5,[2,8]],4],[5,[[9,9],0]]]
[6,[[[6,2],[5,6]],[[7,6],[4,7]]]]
[[[6,[0,7]],[0,9]],[4,[9,[9,0]]]]
[[[7,[6,4]],[3,[1,3]]],[[[5,5],1],9]]
[[6,[[7,3],[3,2]]],[[[3,8],[5,7]],4]]
[[[[5,4],[7,7]],8],[[8,3],8]]
[[9,3],[[9,9],[6,[4,9]]]]
[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]
[[[[5,2],5],[8,[3,7]]],[[5,[7,5]],[4,4]]]
```

The largest magnitude of the sum of any two snailfish numbers in this list is **`3993`**. This is the magnitude of `[[2,[[7,7],7]],[[5,8],[[9,3],[0,2]]]]` + `[[[0,[5,8]],[[1,7],[9,6]]],[[4,[1,2]],[[1,4],2]]]`, which reduces to `[[[[7,8],[6,6]],[[6,0],[7,7]]],[[[7,8],[8,8]],[[7,9],[0,6]]]]`.

**What is the largest magnitude of any sum of two different snailfish numbers from the homework assignment?**

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](input.txt).
