## --- Part Two ---

Things aren't looking good for the reindeer. The man asks whether more milk and cookies would help you think.

If only you could give the reindeer's immune system a boost, you might be able to change the outcome of the combat.

A **boost** is an integer increase in immune system units' attack damage. For example, if you were to boost the above example's immune system's units by `1570`, the armies would instead look like this:

```
Immune System:
17 units each with 5390 hit points (weak to radiation, bludgeoning) with
 an attack that does 6077 fire damage at initiative 2
989 units each with 1274 hit points (immune to fire; weak to bludgeoning,
 slashing) with an attack that does 1595 slashing damage at initiative 3

Infection:
801 units each with 4706 hit points (weak to radiation) with an attack
 that does 116 bludgeoning damage at initiative 1
4485 units each with 2961 hit points (immune to radiation; weak to fire,
 cold) with an attack that does 12 slashing damage at initiative 4
```

With this boost, the combat proceeds differently:

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 989 units
Group 1 contains 17 units
Infection:
Group 1 contains 801 units
Group 2 contains 4485 units

Infection group 1 would deal defending group 2 185832 damage
Infection group 1 would deal defending group 1 185832 damage
Infection group 2 would deal defending group 1 53820 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 1 1577455 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 1577455 damage
Immune System group 1 would deal defending group 2 206618 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 1, killing 9 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 1, killing 335 units
Immune System group 1 attacks defending group 2, killing 32 units
Infection group 1 attacks defending group 2, killing 84 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 905 units
Group 1 contains 8 units
Infection:
Group 1 contains 466 units
Group 2 contains 4453 units

Infection group 1 would deal defending group 2 108112 damage
Infection group 1 would deal defending group 1 108112 damage
Infection group 2 would deal defending group 1 53436 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 1 1443475 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 1443475 damage
Immune System group 1 would deal defending group 2 97232 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 1, killing 8 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 1, killing 306 units
Infection group 1 attacks defending group 2, killing 29 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 876 units
Infection:
Group 2 contains 4453 units
Group 1 contains 160 units

Infection group 2 would deal defending group 2 106872 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 1397220 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 1 1397220 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 83 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 427 units
```

After a few fights...

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 64 units
Infection:
Group 2 contains 214 units
Group 1 contains 19 units

Infection group 2 would deal defending group 2 5136 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 102080 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 1 102080 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 4 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 32 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 60 units
Infection:
Group 1 contains 19 units
Group 2 contains 182 units

Infection group 1 would deal defending group 2 4408 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 1 95700 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 95700 damage

Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 1, killing 19 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 60 units
Infection:
Group 2 contains 182 units

Infection group 2 would deal defending group 2 4368 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 95700 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 3 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 30 units
```

After a few more fights...

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 51 units
Infection:
Group 2 contains 40 units

Infection group 2 would deal defending group 2 960 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 81345 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 0 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 27 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 51 units
Infection:
Group 2 contains 13 units

Infection group 2 would deal defending group 2 312 damage
Immune System group 2 would deal defending group 2 81345 damage

Infection group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 0 units
Immune System group 2 attacks defending group 2, killing 13 units
```

```
Immune System:
Group 2 contains 51 units
Infection:
No groups remain.
```

This boost would allow the immune system's armies to win! It would be left with **`51`** units.

You don't even know **how** you could boost the reindeer's immune system or what effect it might have, so you need to be cautious and find the **smallest boost** that would allow the immune system to win.

**How many units does the immune system have left** after getting the smallest boost it needs to win?

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](input.txt).
