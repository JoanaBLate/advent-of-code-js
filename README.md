## Clear and *BLAZINGLY FAST* solutions in JS

The code is written in the **most basic vanilla JavaScript**, without external libraries (excepting crypto), trying to be very accessible for everybody.

Solutions are made in an  optimized (when needed) **computing/programming style**, NOT by applying magical math formulas.

NOTE: *Before year 2024*, the measured times INCLUDE the Deno starting up time (around 0.025s).
