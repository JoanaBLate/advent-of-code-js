## --- Part Two ---

To simplify the problem further, the GPU would like to remove any particles that **collide**. Particles collide if their positions ever **exactly match**. Because particles are updated simultaneously, **more than two particles** can collide at the same time and place. Once particles collide, they are removed and cannot collide with anything else after that tick.

For example:

```
p=<-6,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    
p=<-4,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
p=<-2,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    (0)   (1)   (2)            (3)
p=< 3,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>

p=<-3,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    
p=<-2,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
p=<-1,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>             (0)(1)(2)      (3)   
p=< 2,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>

p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 3,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    
p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 2,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
p=< 0,0,0>, v=< 1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>                       X (3)      
p=< 1,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>

------destroyed by collision------    
------destroyed by collision------    -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3
------destroyed by collision------                      (3)         
p=< 0,0,0>, v=<-1,0,0>, a=< 0,0,0>
```

In this example, particles `0`, `1`, and `2` are simultaneously destroyed at the time and place marked `X`. On the next tick, particle `3` passes through unharmed.

**How many particles are left** after all collisions are resolved?

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](input.txt).
