## --- Part Two ---

All this drifting around in space makes you wonder about the nature of the universe. Does history really repeat itself? You're curious whether the moons will ever return to a previous state.

Determine **the number of steps** that must occur before all of the moons' **positions and velocities** exactly match a previous point in time.

For example, the first example above takes `2772` steps before they exactly match a previous point in time; it eventually returns to the initial state:

```
After 0 steps:
pos=<x= -1, y=  0, z=  2>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  2, y=-10, z= -7>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  4, y= -8, z=  8>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  3, y=  5, z= -1>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>

After 2770 steps:
pos=<x=  2, y= -1, z=  1>, vel=<x= -3, y=  2, z=  2>
pos=<x=  3, y= -7, z= -4>, vel=<x=  2, y= -5, z= -6>
pos=<x=  1, y= -7, z=  5>, vel=<x=  0, y= -3, z=  6>
pos=<x=  2, y=  2, z=  0>, vel=<x=  1, y=  6, z= -2>

After 2771 steps:
pos=<x= -1, y=  0, z=  2>, vel=<x= -3, y=  1, z=  1>
pos=<x=  2, y=-10, z= -7>, vel=<x= -1, y= -3, z= -3>
pos=<x=  4, y= -8, z=  8>, vel=<x=  3, y= -1, z=  3>
pos=<x=  3, y=  5, z= -1>, vel=<x=  1, y=  3, z= -1>

After 2772 steps:
pos=<x= -1, y=  0, z=  2>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  2, y=-10, z= -7>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  4, y= -8, z=  8>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
pos=<x=  3, y=  5, z= -1>, vel=<x=  0, y=  0, z=  0>
```

Of course, the universe might last for a **very long time** before repeating. Here's a copy of the second example from above:

```
<x=-8, y=-10, z=0>
<x=5, y=5, z=10>
<x=2, y=-7, z=3>
<x=9, y=-8, z=-3>
```

This set of initial positions takes `4686774924` steps before it repeats a previous state! Clearly, you might need to **find a more efficient way to simulate the universe**.

**How many steps does it take** to reach the first state that exactly matches a previous state?

Although it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](input.txt).
